# Diff File Changes with Triggers

Check triggers against a diff of changed files. Supports PR events (including fork PRs), push events, workflow_dispatch, and other GitHub Actions events. Useful for conditional builds and deployments based on file changes.

## Features

- ✅ **Fork PR Support**: Automatically handles fork and non-fork PRs
- ✅ **Push Event Support**: Works with push events for deployer workflows
- ✅ **Flexible Ref Comparison**: Compare against any ref (branch, commit SHA, HEAD^, etc.)
- ✅ **Smart Path Matching**: Uses git pathspec matching for accurate trigger detection
- ✅ **Space Handling**: Properly handles trigger paths containing spaces
- ✅ **Visible Logging**: Prominent banners and collapsible details in step logs, plus notice annotations in workflow summary and annotations views

# Usage

```yaml
- uses: bcgov-nr/action-diff-triggers@vX.Y.Z
  with:
    ### Required

    # Paths used to check against file change (diff)
    # Supports quoted strings with spaces: ('backend/' 'my path/file.txt')
    triggers: ('backend/' 'frontend/')

    ### Optional

    # Reference to compare against
    # - PR events: defaults to base repo default branch
    # - Other events (push, workflow_dispatch, etc.): defaults to HEAD^
    ref: main  # Branch, commit SHA, tag, or local ref (HEAD^, HEAD~2). Local refs work for non-PR events only
```

# Output

Returns `triggered: true` if triggers fire, `triggered: false` otherwise.

# Logging & Visibility

The action provides detailed logging directly in the step output for easy debugging and visibility:

- **Banner** — A collapsible group clearly showing triggered/not-triggered status, with supplementary caller context in brackets: `[workflow / job]`
- **Collapsible details** — Trigger configuration and per-trigger match results inside the group
- **Ref source** — Shows whether comparison ref came from explicit input (`input`) or default behavior (`default`)
- **Annotations** — `::notice::` annotations that appear in the workflow summary and annotations tab (e.g., `::notice title=Diff Triggers::ℹ️ Diff Triggers not fired. (owner/repo)`)

# Examples

## Pull Request Event (Typical Pattern)

Check if files have changed, then do something else. This is useful for cases like builds, where a job is usually only needed conditionally.

Please replace `@vX.Y.Z` with the latest version number.

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  check:
    name: Check Triggers Against Diff
    outputs:
      triggered: ${{ steps.test.outputs.triggered }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - uses: bcgov-nr/action-diff-triggers@vX.Y.Z
        id: test
        with:
          triggers: ('backend/' 'frontend/')

  build:
    name: Build if Triggered
    needs: [check]
    if: needs.check.outputs.triggered == 'true'
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build
        run: |
          echo "Building because triggers matched!"
```

## Push Event

Compare current commit to previous commit (HEAD vs HEAD^):

```yaml
on:
  push:

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - uses: bcgov-nr/action-diff-triggers@vX.Y.Z
        id: test
        with:
          triggers: ('backend/' 'frontend/')
          # ref defaults to HEAD^ for push events
```

## Workflow Dispatch Event

Works with manual triggers and other events. Defaults to comparing HEAD vs HEAD^:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  check:
    name: Check Triggers
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - uses: bcgov-nr/action-diff-triggers@vX.Y.Z
        with:
          triggers: ('backend/')
          # ref defaults to HEAD^ for non-PR events
          # Can override: ref: main
```

## Compare Against Specific Commit

```yaml
- uses: bcgov-nr/action-diff-triggers@vX.Y.Z
  with:
    triggers: ('backend/')
    ref: abc123def456  # Compare against specific commit
```

## Fork PR Support

The action automatically handles fork PRs in `pull_request_target` context - no configuration needed!

```yaml
on:
  pull_request_target:  # Works with fork PRs!

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - uses: bcgov-nr/action-diff-triggers@vX.Y.Z
        with:
          triggers: ('backend/')
```
